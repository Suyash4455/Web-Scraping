# Web-Scraping


This project simulates a simple web scraper using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When you click the "Start Scraping" button, it displays fake product data (name, price, rating) in a clean table format — just like a real web scraper would do after collecting data from an e-commerce website.

It’s a great frontend-only demo to understand how scraped data can be structured and displayed in a webpage.
